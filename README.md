# Recipe App

A React recipe app that uses an API for searching and viewing recipes.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to search for recipes by ingredients, cuisine, diet, or meal type. Users can also view the details, ingredients, and instructions of each recipe. The project uses React for the front-end, [Edamam Recipe Search API](https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api) for the back-end, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Usage

The app has a simple and user-friendly interface. On the homepage, you can see an into, and the latest recipes.

On the Browse page, you can see a search bar where you can enter your query. You can also use the filters to narrow down your search by cuisine, or meal type.

When you click on a recipe, you will see a detailed page with more information, such as the calories, servings, cooking time, ingredients, and instructions. You can also see the recommendations based on the selected recipe.
