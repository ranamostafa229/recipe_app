# Recipe App

A React recipe app that uses an API for searching and viewing recipes.

## Description

This project is a web application that allows users to search for recipes by ingredients, cuisine, diet, or meal type. Users can also view the details, ingredients, and instructions of each recipe. The project uses React for the front-end, and [Edamam Recipe Search API](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/) for the back-end.

## Installation

To install and run this project, you need to have [Node.js](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) and [npm](https://docs.github.com/articles/markdown-basics) installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project folder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key and ID from [Edamam] as `REACT_APP_API_KEY` and `REACT_APP_API_ID` respectively.
4. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
5. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app.

## Usage

The app has a simple and user-friendly interface. On the homepage, you can see a search bar where you can enter your query. You can also use the filters to narrow down your search by cuisine, diet, or meal type.

When you click on a recipe, you will see a detailed page with more information, such as the calories, servings, cooking time, ingredients, and instructions. You can also save the recipe to your favorites, or share it with others.
